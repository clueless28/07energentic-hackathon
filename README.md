**GridSense** is an agentic demand-response marketplace for residential and small-commercial energy users.  
Built on the open **Beckn-ONIX** protocol and powered by Google Cloud’s **Agent Development Kit(ADK)**, GridSense enables households to discover, bid, and automate flexible load adjustments—such as HVAC, EV charging, and water heating—in response to dynamic grid signals.

By coordinating AI agents across devices, GridSense enhances grid stability, unlocks revenue streams for participants, and accelerates decarbonization.

## 🔧 Challenges Addressed

### 1. Peak Demand Spikes
Uncoordinated residential loads—like air conditioners and EVs—exacerbate grid peaks, triggering expensive, dirty peaker plants and risking outages.

### 2. Siloed Energy Management
Most home energy systems are proprietary and isolated, limiting large-scale aggregated demand-response.

### 3. Monetization & User Engagement
Consumers lack simple, automated ways to earn by adjusting flexible loads—leading to low participation.

## ⚙️ Core Concept

GridSense enables multi-transactional AI agents to autonomously:

- **Discover**: Identify demand-response events using Beckn discovery APIs.
- **Negotiate**: Bid flexible load reductions in return for dynamic payments via RL-driven strategies.
- **Execute**: Automate load curtailment, meter adjustments, and settle micropayments using Beckn transaction APIs.

## 🔌 What is GridSense?

GridSense is a smart system that helps homes and small businesses save on energy bills *while* supporting grid reliability and sustainability—all powered by AI agents talking to each other through open protocols.

> Imagine your appliances slightly adjusting themselves—like delaying your water heater or pausing EV charging for a few minutes—when the grid is under stress. In return, you earn credits or cash. All automatically.

---

## ⚡ Why Now?

- Rising energy demand from EVs, ACs, and connected devices  
- Unpredictable solar/wind generation  
- Climate change–driven demand spikes (e.g., heatwaves)  
- Reliance on peaker plants—expensive and polluting

## 🎯 What Does GridSense Do?

GridSense turns homes into “smart allies” of the grid.

### Agents inside devices:
- **Listen** to grid signals like "high price now!" or "load shedding ahead!"
- **Decide** how to adjust (e.g., reduce AC by 1°C or delay EV charging)
- **Bid** into a real-time marketplace (e.g., "I can cut 1kW for ₹10")
- **Earn** incentives automatically when the bid is accepted
- **Restore** operation when grid conditions normalize

You stay comfortable. The grid stays stable. You get rewarded.

## 🧠 Why “Agentic AI”?

Agentic AI refers to autonomous software entities that make decisions, coordinate, and act on your behalf.

In GridSense:
- One agent may represent your EV charger
- Another agent may represent the utility
- They **negotiate, coordinate, and transact**—like a real-time energy marketplace

These agents use:
- **Reinforcement Learning**
- **Real-time Grid Data**
- **Preference-based Optimization**

## 🌐 Why Beckn & ONIX?

- **Beckn Protocol** is an open standard for digital commerce, now extended to energy through **ONIX**.
- Like UPI enables seamless payments across banks, **Beckn-ONIX** enables seamless energy interactions across devices, utilities, and platforms.
- Ensures **interoperability**, **extensibility**, and **ecosystem collaboration**.

## 🏁 Example in Action

> **Scenario**: It's a hot day at 6 PM.  
> Everyone’s AC is blasting. The grid is overloaded.

1. GridSense signals: “Who can reduce usage for 15 minutes?”
2. Your home agent responds: “I'll delay EV charging + adjust thermostat by 1°C for ₹15.”
3. You don’t notice the change.
4. Grid remains stable. You earn rewards—**automatically**.
